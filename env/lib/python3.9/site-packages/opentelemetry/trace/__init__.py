"""
The OpenTelemetry tracing API describes the classes used to generate
distributed traces.

The :class:`.Tracer` class controls access to the execution context, and
manages span creation. Each operation in a trace is represented by a
:class:`.Span`, which records the start, end time, and metadata associated with
the operation.

This module provides abstract (i.e. unimplemented) classes required for
tracing, and a concrete no-op :class:`.NonRecordingSpan` that allows applications
to use the API package alone without a supporting implementation.

To get a tracer, you need to provide the package name from which you are
calling the tracer APIs to OpenTelemetry by calling `TracerProvider.get_tracer`
with the calling module name and the version of your package.

The tracer supports creating spans that are "attached" or "detached" from the
context. New spans are "attached" to the context in that they are
created as children of the currently active span, and the newly-created span
can optionally become the new active span::

    from opentelemetry import trace

    tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

    # Create a new root span, set it as the current span in context
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("parent"):
        # Attach a new child and update the current span
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("child"):
            do_work():
        # Close child span, set parent as current
    # Close parent span, set default span as current

When creating a span that's "detached" from the context the active span doesn't
change, and the caller is responsible for managing the span's lifetime::

    # Explicit parent span assignment is done via the Context
    from opentelemetry.trace import set_span_in_context

    context = set_span_in_context(parent)
    child = tracer.start_span("child", context=context)

    try:
        do_work(span=child)
    finally:
        child.end()

Applications should generally use a single global TracerProvider, and use
either implicit or explicit context propagation consistently throughout.

.. versionadded:: 0.1.0
.. versionchanged:: 0.3.0
    `TracerProvider` was introduced and the global ``tracer`` getter was
    replaced by ``tracer_provider``.
.. versionchanged:: 0.5.0
    ``tracer_provider`` was replaced by `get_tracer_provider`,
    ``set_preferred_tracer_provider_implementation`` was replaced by
    `set_tracer_provider`.

        The span can be used as a context manager. On exiting the context manager,
        the span's end() method will be called.
