CONTAINER_COMMAND: Final = "container.command"
"""
The command used to run the container (i.e. the command name).
Note: If using embedded credentials or sensitive data, it is recommended to remove them to prevent potential leakage.
"""

CONTAINER_COMMAND_ARGS: Final = "container.command_args"
"""
All the command arguments (including the command/executable itself) run by the container. [2].
"""

CONTAINER_COMMAND_LINE: Final = "container.command_line"
"""
The full command run by the container as a single string representing the full command. [2].
"""

CONTAINER_CPU_STATE: Final = "container.cpu.state"
"""
Deprecated: Replaced by `cpu.mode`.
"""

CONTAINER_ID: Final = "container.id"
"""
Container ID. Usually a UUID, as for example used to [identify Docker containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#container-identification). The UUID might be abbreviated.
"""

CONTAINER_IMAGE_ID: Final = "container.image.id"
"""
Runtime specific image identifier. Usually a hash algorithm followed by a UUID.
Note: Docker defines a sha256 of the image id; `container.image.id` corresponds to the `Image` field from the Docker container inspect [API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.43/#tag/Container/operation/ContainerInspect) endpoint.
K8s defines a link to the container registry repository with digest `"imageID": "registry.azurecr.io /namespace/service/dockerfile@sha256:bdeabd40c3a8a492eaf9e8e44d0ebbb84bac7ee25ac0cf8a7159d25f62555625"`.
The ID is assigned by the container runtime and can vary in different environments. Consider using `oci.manifest.digest` if it is important to identify the same image in different environments/runtimes.
"""

CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME: Final = "container.image.name"
"""
Name of the image the container was built on.
"""

CONTAINER_IMAGE_REPO_DIGESTS: Final = "container.image.repo_digests"

Repo digests of the container image as provided by the container runtime.
Note: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.43/#tag/Image/operation/ImageInspect) and [CRI](https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api/blob/c75ef5b473bbe2d0a4fc92f82235efd665ea8e9f/pkg/apis/runtime/v1/api.proto#L1237-L1238) report those under the `RepoDigests` field.
"""

CONTAINER_IMAGE_TAGS: Final = "container.image.tags"
"""
Container image tags. An example can be found in [Docker Image Inspect](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.43/#tag/Image/operation/ImageInspect). Should be only the `<tag>` section of the full name for example from `registry.example.com/my-org/my-image:<tag>`.

Container labels, `<key>` being the label name, the value being the label value.

Deprecated: Replaced by `container.label`.

CONTAINER_NAME: Final = "container.name"

Container name used by container runtime.

The container runtime managing this container.
