Chroma lets you manage collections of embeddings, using the **collection** primitive. Collections are the fundamental unit of storage and querying in Chroma.

## Creating Collections

Chroma collections are created with a name. Collection names are used in the url, so there are a few restrictions on them:

- The length of the name must be between 3 and 512 characters.
- The name must start and end with a lowercase letter or a digit, and it can contain dots, dashes, and underscores in between.
- The name must not contain two consecutive dots.
- The name must not be a valid IP address.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
collection = client.create_collection(name="my_collection")
```

```typescript TypeScript
const collection = await client.createCollection({
  name: "my_collection",
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Note that collection names must be **unique** inside a Chroma database. If you try to create a collection with a name of an existing one, you will see an exception.

### Embedding Functions

When you add documents to a collection, Chroma will embed them for you by using the collection's **embedding function**. Chroma will use [sentence transformer](https://www.sbert.net/index.html) embedding function as a default.

Chroma also offers various embedding function, which you can provide upon creating a collection. For example, you can create a collection using the `OpenAIEmbeddingFunction`:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python" icon="python">

Install the `openai` package:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install openai
```

```bash poetry
poetry add openai
```

```bash uv
uv pip install openai
```
</CodeGroup>

Create your collection with the `OpenAIEmbeddingFunction`:

```python
import os
from chromadb.utils.embedding_functions import OpenAIEmbeddingFunction

collection = client.create_collection(
    name="my_collection",
    embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddingFunction(
        api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
        model_name="text-embedding-3-small"
    )
)
```

Instead of having Chroma embed documents, you can also provide embeddings directly when [adding data](./add-data) to a collection. In this case, your collection will not have an embedding function set, and you will be responsible for providing embeddings directly when adding data and querying.

```python
collection = client.create_collection(
    name="my_collection",
    embedding_function=None
)
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript" icon="js">

Install the `@chroma-core/openai` package to get access to the `OpenAIEmbeddingFunction`:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @chroma-core/openai
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @chroma-core/openai
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @chroma-core/openai
```

```bash bun
bun add @chroma-core/openai
```
</CodeGroup>

Create your collection with the `OpenAIEmbeddingFunction`:

```typescript
import { OpenAIEmbeddingFunction } from "@chroma-core/openai";

const collection = await client.createCollection({
  name: "my_collection",
  embeddingFunction: new OpenAIEmbeddingFunction({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    modelName: "text-embedding-3-small",
  }),
});
```

Instead of having Chroma embed documents, you can also provide embeddings directly when [adding data](./add-data) to a collection. In this case, your collection will not have an embedding function set, and you will be responsible for providing embeddings directly when adding data and querying.

```typescript
const collection = await client.createCollection({
  name: "my_collection",
  embeddingFunction: null,
});
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Collection Metadata

When creating collections, you can pass the optional `metadata` argument to add a mapping of metadata key-value pairs to your collections. This can be useful for adding general about the collection like creation time, description of the data stored in the collection, and more.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from datetime import datetime

collection = client.create_collection(
    name="my_collection",
    embedding_function=emb_fn,
    metadata={
        "description": "my first Chroma collection",
        "created": str(datetime.now())
    }
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
let collection = await client.createCollection({
  name: "my_collection",
  embeddingFunction: emb_fn,
  metadata: {
    description: "my first Chroma collection",
    created: new Date().toString(),
  },
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Getting Collections

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python" icon="python">

There are several ways to get a collection after it was created.

The `get_collection` function will get a collection from Chroma by name. It returns a `Collection` object with `name`, `metadata`, `configuration`, and `embedding_function`.

```python
collection = client.get_collection(name="my-collection")
```

The `get_or_create_collection` function behaves similarly, but will create the collection if it doesn't exist. You can pass to it the same arguments `create_collection` expects, and the client will ignore them if the collection already exists.

```python
collection = client.get_or_create_collection(
    name="my-collection",
    metadata={"description": "..."}
)
```

The `list_collections` function returns the collections you have in your Chroma database. The collections will be ordered by creation time from oldest to newest.

```python
collections = client.list_collections()
```

By default, `list_collections` returns up to 100 collections. If you have more than 100 collections, or need to get only a subset of your collections, you can use the `limit` and `offset` arguments:

```python
first_collections_batch = client.list_collections(limit=100) # get the first 100 collections
second_collections_batch = client.list_collections(limit=100, offset=100) # get the next 100 collections
collections_subset = client.list_collections(limit=20, offset=50) # get 20 collections starting from the 50th
```

Current versions of Chroma store the embedding function you used to create a collection on the server, so the client can resolve it for you on subsequent "get" operations. If you are running an older version of the Chroma client or server (earlier than 1.1.13), you will need to provide the same embedding function you used to create a collection when using `get_collection`:

```python
collection = client.get_collection(
    name='my-collection',
    embedding_function=ef
)
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript" icon="js">

There are several ways to get a collection after it was created.

The `getCollection` function will get a collection from Chroma by name. It returns a collection object with `name`, `metadata`, `configuration`, and `embeddingFunction`. If you did not provide an embedding function to `createCollection`, you can provide it to `getCollection`.

```typescript
const collection = await client.getCollection({ name: "my-collection " });
```

The `getOrCreate` function behaves similarly, but will create the collection if it doesn't exist. You can pass to it the same arguments `createCollection` expects, and the client will ignore them if the collection already exists.

```typescript
const collection = await client.getOrCreateCollection({
  name: "my-collection",
  metadata: { description: "..." },
});
```

If you need to get multiple collections at once, you can use `getCollections()`:

```typescript
const [col1, col2] = client.getCollections(["col1", "col2"]);
```

The `listCollections` function returns all the collections you have in your Chroma database. The collections will be ordered by creation time from oldest to newest.

```typescript
const collections = await client.listCollections();
```

By default, `listCollections` returns up to 100 collections. If you have more than 100 collections, or need to get only a subset of your collections, you can use the `limit` and `offset` arguments:

```typescript
const firstCollectionsBatch = await client.listCollections({ limit: 100 }); // get the first 100 collections
const secondCollectionsBatch = await client.listCollections({
  limit: 100,
  offset: 100,
}); // get the next 100 collections
const collectionsSubset = await client.listCollections({
  limit: 20,
  offset: 50,
}); // get 20 collections starting from the 50th
```

Current versions of Chroma store the embedding function you used to create a collection on the server, so the client can resolve it for you on subsequent "get" operations. If you are running an older version of the Chroma JS/TS client (earlier than 3.04) or server (earlier than 1.1.13), you will need to provide the same embedding function you used to create a collection when using `getCollection` and `getCollections`:

```typescript
const collection = await client.getCollection({
  name: "my-collection",
  embeddingFunction: ef,
});

const [col1, col2] = client.getCollections([
  { name: "col1", embeddingFunction: openaiEF },
  { name: "col2", embeddingFunction: defaultEF },
]);
```

## Modifying Collections

After a collection is created, you can modify its name, metadata and elements of its [index configuration](./configure) with the `modify` method:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
collection.modify(
   name="new-name",
   metadata={"description": "new description"}
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
await collection.modify({
  name: "new-name",
  metadata: { description: "new description" },
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Deleting Collections

You can delete a collection by name. This action will delete a collection, all of its embeddings, and associated documents and records' metadata.

<Warning>
Deleting collections is destructive and not reversible
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
client.delete_collection(name="my-collection")
```

```typescript TypeScript
await client.deleteCollection({ name: "my-collection" });
```
</CodeGroup>

## Convenience Methods

Collections also offer a few useful convenience methods:

- `count` - returns the number of records in the collection.
- `peek` - returns the first 10 records in the collection.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
collection.count()
collection.peek()
```

```typescript TypeScript
await collection.count();
await collection.peek();
```
</CodeGroup>
