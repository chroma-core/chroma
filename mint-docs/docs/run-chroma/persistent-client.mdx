You can configure Chroma to save and load the database from your local machine, using the PersistentClient.

Data will be persisted automatically and loaded on start (if it exists).

```python Python
import chromadb

client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="/path/to/save/to")
```

The path is where Chroma will store its database files on disk, and load them on start. If you don't provide a path, the default is .chroma

The client object has a few useful convenience methods.

- heartbeat() - returns a nanosecond heartbeat. Useful for making sure the client remains connected.
- reset() - empties and completely resets the database. <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" color="orange" /> This is destructive and not reversible.

```python Python
client.heartbeat()
client.reset()
```

To connect with the JS/TS client, you must connect to a Chroma server.

To run a Chroma server locally that will persist your data, install Chroma from npm using any npm compatible client.

```bash Terminal
npm install chromadb
```

And run the server using our CLI:

```bash Terminal
npx chroma run --path ./getting-started
```

The path is where Chroma will store its database files on disk, and load them on start. The default is .chroma.

Alternatively, you can also use our official Docker image:

```bash Terminal
docker pull chromadb/chroma
docker run -p 8000:8000 chromadb/chroma
```

With a Chroma server running locally, you can connect to it by instantiating a new ChromaClient:

```typescript TypeScript
import { ChromaClient } from "chromadb";

const client = new ChromaClient();
```

By default, the ChromaClient is wired to connect to a Chroma server at http://localhost:8000, with default\_tenant and default\_database. If you have different settings you can provide them to the ChromaClient constructor:

```typescript TypeScript
const client = new ChromaClient({
  ssl: false,
  host: "localhost",
  port: 9000, // non-standard port based on your server config
  database: "my-db",
  headers: {},
});
```

The client object has a few useful convenience methods.

- heartbeat() - returns a nanosecond heartbeat. Useful for making sure the client remains connected.
- reset() - empties and completely resets the database. <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" color="orange" /> This is destructive and not reversible.

```typescript TypeScript
await client.heartbeat();
await client.reset();
```
