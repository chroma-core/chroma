## Install with AI

Give the following prompt to Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or your favorite AI agent. It will quickly set you up with Chroma.

<CodeGroup>
```prompt Chroma Cloud
In this directory create a new Python project with Chroma set up.
Use a virtual environment.

Write a small example that adds some data to a collection and queries it.
Do not delete the data from the collection when it's complete.
Run the script when you are done setting up the environment and writing the
script. The output should show what data was ingested, what was the query,
and the results.
Your own summary should include this output so the user can see it.

First, install `chromadb`.

The project should be set up with Chroma Cloud. When you install `chromadb`,
you get access to the Chroma CLI. You can run `chroma login` to authenticate.
This will open a browser for authentication and save a connection profile
locally.

You can also use `chroma profile show` to see if the user already has an
active profile saved locally. If so, you can skip the login step.

Then create a DB using the CLI with `chroma db create chroma-getting-started`.
This will create a DB with this name.

Then use the CLI command `chroma db connect chroma-getting-started --env-file`.
This will create a .env file in the current directory with the connection
variables for this DB and account, so the CloudClient can be instantiated
with chromadb.CloudClient(api_key=os.getenv("CHROMA_API_KEY"), ...).
```

Use Chroma's in-memory client: `chromadb.Client()`
```

## Install Manually

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Install">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash pip
    pip install chromadb
    ```
    ```bash poetry
    poetry add chromadb
    ```
    ```bash uv
    uv pip install chromadb
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Chroma Client">
    ```python Python
    import chromadb
    chroma_client = chromadb.Client()
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a collection">
    Collections are where you'll store your embeddings, documents, and any additional metadata. Collections index your embeddings and documents, and enable efficient retrieval and filtering. You can create a collection with a name:

    ```python Python
    collection = chroma_client.create_collection(name="my_collection")
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add some text documents to the collection">
    Chroma will store your text and handle embedding and indexing automatically. You can also customize the embedding model. You must provide unique string IDs for your documents.

    ```python Python
    collection.add(
        ids=["id1", "id2"],
        documents=[
            "This is a document about pineapple",
            "This is a document about oranges"
        ]
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Query the collection">
    You can query the collection with a list of query texts, and Chroma will return the n most similar results. It's that easy!

    ```python Python
    results = collection.query(
        query_texts=["This is a query document about hawaii"], # Chroma will embed this for you
        n_results=2 # how many results to return
    )
    print(results)
    ```

    If n\_results is not provided, Chroma will return 10 results by default. Here we only added 2 documents, so we set n\_results=2.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Inspect Results">
    From the above - you can see that our query about hawaii is semantically most similar to the document about pineapple.

    ```python Python
    {
      'documents': [[
          'This is a document about pineapple',
          'This is a document about oranges'
      ]],
      'ids': [['id1', 'id2']],
      'distances': [[1.0404009819030762, 1.243080496788025]],
      'uris': None,
      'data': None,
      'metadatas': [[None, None]],
      'embeddings': None,
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try it out yourself">
    What if we tried querying with "This is a document about florida"? Here is a full example.

    ```python Python expandable
    import chromadb
    chroma_client = chromadb.Client()

    # switch \`create_collection\` to \`get_or_create_collection\` to avoid creating a new collection every time
    collection = chroma_client.get_or_create_collection(name="my_collection")

    # switch \`add\` to \`upsert\` to avoid adding the same documents every time
    collection.upsert(
        documents=[
            "This is a document about pineapple",
            "This is a document about oranges"
        ],
        ids=["id1", "id2"]
    )

    results = collection.query(
        query_texts=["This is a query document about florida"], # Chroma will embed this for you
        n_results=2 # how many results to return
    )

    print(results)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next steps

In this guide we used Chroma's [in-memory client](/docs/run-chroma/clients#in-memory-client) for simplicity. It starts a Chroma server in-memory, so any data you ingest will be lost when your program terminates. You can use the [persistent client](/docs/run-chroma/clients#persistent-client) or run Chroma in [client-server mode](/docs/run-chroma/client-server) if you need data persistence.

You will have to run a local Chroma server to make this work. When you install
`chromadb` you get access to the Chroma CLI, which can start a local server
for you with `chroma run`.

Make sure to instruct the user on how to start a local Chroma server in your
summary.

## Install Manually

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Install">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm install chromadb @chroma-core/default-embed
    ```
    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add chromadb @chroma-core/default-embed
    ```
    ```bash bun
    bun add chromadb @chroma-core/default-embed
    ```
    ```bash yarn
    yarn add chromadb @chroma-core/default-embed
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Chroma Client">
    Run the Chroma backend:

    ```bash Terminal CLI
    chroma run --path ./getting-started
    ```
    ```bash Terminal Docker
    docker pull chromadb/chroma
    docker run -p 8000:8000 chromadb/chroma
    ```

    Then create a client which connects to it:

    ```typescript TypeScript ESM
    import { ChromaClient } from "chromadb";
    const client = new ChromaClient();
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript CJS
    const { ChromaClient } = require("chromadb");
    const client = new ChromaClient();
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a collection">
    Collections are where you'll store your embeddings, documents, and any additional metadata. Collections index your embeddings and documents, and enable efficient retrieval and filtering. You can create a collection with a name:

    ```typescript TypeScript
    const collection = await client.createCollection({
      name: "my_collection",
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add some text documents to the collection">
    Chroma will store your text and handle embedding and indexing automatically. You can also customize the embedding model. You must provide unique string IDs for your documents.

    ```typescript TypeScript
    await collection.add({
      ids: ["id1", "id2"],
      documents: [
        "This is a document about pineapple",
        "This is a document about oranges",
      ],
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Query the collection">
    You can query the collection with a list of query texts, and Chroma will return the n most similar results. It's that easy!

    ```typescript TypeScript
    const results = await collection.query({
      queryTexts: "This is a query document about hawaii", // Chroma will embed this for you
      nResults: 2, // how many results to return
    });

    console.log(results);
    ```

    If n\_results is not provided, Chroma will return 10 results by default. Here we only added 2 documents, so we set n\_results=2.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Inspect Results">
    From the above - you can see that our query about hawaii is semantically most similar to the document about pineapple.

    ```typescript TypeScript
    {
        documents: [
            [
                'This is a document about pineapple',
                'This is a document about oranges'
            ]
        ],
        ids: [
            ['id1', 'id2']
        ],
        distances: [[1.0404009819030762, 1.243080496788025]],
        uris: null,
        data: null,
        metadatas: [[null, null]],
        embeddings: null
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try it out yourself">
    What if we tried querying with "This is a document about florida"? Here is a full example.

    ```typescript TypeScript expandable
