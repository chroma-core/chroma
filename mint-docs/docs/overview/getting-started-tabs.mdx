<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Install">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash pip
    pip install chromadb
    ```
    ```bash poetry
    poetry add chromadb
    ```
    ```bash uv
    uv pip install chromadb
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Chroma Client">
    ```python Python
    import chromadb
    chroma_client = chromadb.Client()
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a collection">
    Collections are where you'll store your embeddings, documents, and any additional metadata. Collections index your embeddings and documents, and enable efficient retrieval and filtering. You can create a collection with a name:

    ```python Python
    collection = chroma_client.create_collection(name="my_collection")
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add some text documents to the collection">
    Chroma will store your text and handle embedding and indexing automatically. You can also customize the embedding model. You must provide unique string IDs for your documents.

    ```python Python
    collection.add(
        ids=["id1", "id2"],
        documents=[
            "This is a document about pineapple",
            "This is a document about oranges"
        ]
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Query the collection">
    You can query the collection with a list of query texts, and Chroma will return the n most similar results. It's that easy!

    ```python Python
    results = collection.query(
        query_texts=["This is a query document about hawaii"], # Chroma will embed this for you
        n_results=2 # how many results to return
    )
    print(results)
    ```

    If n\_results is not provided, Chroma will return 10 results by default. Here we only added 2 documents, so we set n\_results=2.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Inspect Results">
    From the above - you can see that our query about hawaii is semantically most similar to the document about pineapple.

    ```python Python
    {
      'documents': [[
          'This is a document about pineapple',
          'This is a document about oranges'
      ]],
      'ids': [['id1', 'id2']],
      'distances': [[1.0404009819030762, 1.243080496788025]],
      'uris': None,
      'data': None,
      'metadatas': [[None, None]],
      'embeddings': None,
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try it out yourself">
    What if we tried querying with "This is a document about florida"? Here is a full example.

    ```python Python expandable
    import chromadb
    chroma_client = chromadb.Client()

    # switch \`create_collection\` to \`get_or_create_collection\` to avoid creating a new collection every time
    collection = chroma_client.get_or_create_collection(name="my_collection")

    # switch \`add\` to \`upsert\` to avoid adding the same documents every time
    collection.upsert(
        documents=[
            "This is a document about pineapple",
            "This is a document about oranges"
        ],
        ids=["id1", "id2"]
    )

    results = collection.query(
        query_texts=["This is a query document about florida"], # Chroma will embed this for you
        n_results=2 # how many results to return
    )

    print(results)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

In this guide we used Chroma's [ephemeral client](https://docs.trychroma.com/docs/run-chroma/ephemeral-client) for simplicity. It starts a Chroma server in-memory, so any data you ingest will be lost when your program terminates. You can use the [persistent client](https://docs.trychroma.com/docs/run-chroma/persistent-client) or run Chroma in [client-server mode](https://docs.trychroma.com/docs/run-chroma/client-server) if you need data persistence.

  <Step title="Install">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm install chromadb @chroma-core/default-embed
    ```
    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add chromadb @chroma-core/default-embed
    ```
    ```bash yarn

    bun add chromadb @chroma-core/default-embed

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Chroma Client">
    Run the Chroma backend:

    ```bash Terminal CLI
    chroma run --path ./getting-started
    ```
    ```bash Terminal Docker
    docker pull chromadb/chroma
    docker run -p 8000:8000 chromadb/chroma
    ```

    Then create a client which connects to it:

    ```typescript TypeScript ESM
    import { ChromaClient } from "chromadb";
    const client = new ChromaClient();
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript CJS
    const { ChromaClient } = require("chromadb");
    const client = new ChromaClient();
    ```

    Collections are where you'll store your embeddings, documents, and any additional metadata. Collections index your embeddings and documents, and enable efficient retrieval and filtering. You can create a collection with a name:

    ```typescript TypeScript
    const collection = await client.createCollection({
      name: "my_collection",

    Chroma will store your text and handle embedding and indexing automatically. You can also customize the embedding model. You must provide unique string IDs for your documents.

    ```typescript TypeScript
    await collection.add({

        "This is a document about oranges",
      ],
    });
    ```
  </Step>

    You can query the collection with a list of query texts, and Chroma will return the n most similar results. It's that easy!

    ```typescript TypeScript
    const results = await collection.query({
      queryTexts: "This is a query document about hawaii", // Chroma will embed this for you
      nResults: 2, // how many results to return
    });

    console.log(results);
    ```

    If n\_results is not provided, Chroma will return 10 results by default. Here we only added 2 documents, so we set n\_results=2.

        embeddings: null
    }
