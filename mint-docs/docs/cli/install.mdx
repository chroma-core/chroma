The Chroma CLI lets you run a Chroma server locally on your machine, install sample apps, browse your collections, interact with your Chroma Cloud DBs, and much more!

When you install our Python or JavaScript package globally, you will automatically get the Chroma CLI.

If you don't use one of our packages, you can still install the CLI as a standalone program with `cURL` (or `iex` on Windows).

## Python

You can install Chroma using `pip`:

```bash
pip install chromadb
```

If you're machine does not allow for global `pip` installs, you can get the Chroma CLI with `pipx`:

```bash
pipx install chromadb
```

## JavaScript

<CodeGroup>
```bash yarn
yarn global add chromadb
```

```bash npm
npm install -g chromadb
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g chromadb
```

```bash bun
bun add -g chromadb
```
</CodeGroup>

## Install Globally

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chroma-core/chroma/main/rust/cli/install/install.sh | bash
```

```bash Windows
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chroma-core/chroma/main/rust/cli/install/install.ps1'))
```
