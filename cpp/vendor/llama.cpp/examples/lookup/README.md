Demonstration of Prompt Lookup Decoding

https://github.com/apoorvumang/prompt-lookup-decoding

The key parameters for lookup decoding are `ngram_min`, `ngram_max` and `n_draft`. The first two determine the size of the ngrams to search for in the prompt for a match. The latter specifies how many subsequent tokens to draft if a match is found.
