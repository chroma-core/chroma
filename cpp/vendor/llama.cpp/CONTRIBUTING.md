# Pull requests (for contributors)

- Test your changes:
  - Using the commands in the [`tests`](tests) folder. For instance, running the `./tests/test-backend-ops` command tests different backend implementations of the GGML library
  - Execute [the full CI locally on your machine](ci/README.md) before publishing
- Please rate the complexity of your PR (i.e. `Review Complexity : Low`, `Review Complexity : Medium`, `Review Complexity : High`). This makes it easier for maintainers to triage the PRs.
  - The PR template has a series of review complexity checkboxes `[ ]` that [you can mark as](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists) `[X]` for your convenience
- Consider allowing write access to your branch for faster review
- If your PR becomes stale, don't hesitate to ping the maintainers in the comments

# Pull requests (for collaborators)

- Squash-merge PRs
- Use the following format for the squashed commit title: `<module> : <commit title> (#<issue_number>)`. For example: `utils : fix typo in utils.py (#1234)`
- Optionally, pick a `<module>` from here: https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/wiki/Modules

# Coding guidelines

- Avoid adding third-party dependencies, extra files, extra headers, etc.
- Always consider cross-compatibility with other operating systems and architectures
- Avoid fancy looking modern STL constructs, use basic `for` loops, avoid templates, keep it simple
- There are no strict rules for the code style, but try to follow the patterns in the code (indentation, spaces, etc.). Vertical alignment makes things more readable and easier to batch edit
- Clean-up any trailing whitespaces, use 4 spaces for indentation, brackets on the same line, `void * ptr`, `int & a`
- Naming usually optimizes for common prefix (see https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/pull/302#discussion_r1243240963)
- Tensors store data in row-major order. We refer to dimension 0 as columns, 1 as rows, 2 as matrices
- Matrix multiplication is unconventional: [`C = ggml_mul_mat(ctx, A, B)`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/880e352277fc017df4d5794f0c21c44e1eae2b84/ggml.h#L1058-L1064) means $C^T = A B^T \Leftrightarrow C = B A^T.$
