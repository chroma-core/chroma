   * This is used for bundler compatibility fix when using Webpack with `import.meta.url` inside ESM module.
   *
   * The default behavior of some bundlers (eg. Webpack) is to rewrite `import.meta.url` to the file local path at
   * compile time. This behavior will break the following code:
   * ```js
   * new Worker(new URL(import.meta.url), { type: 'module' });
   * ```
   *
   * This is because the `import.meta.url` will be rewritten to a local path, so the line above will be equivalent to:
   * ```js
   * new Worker(new URL('file:///path/to/your/file.js'), { type: 'module' });
   * ```
   *
   * This will cause the browser fails to load the worker script.
   *
   * To fix this, we need to align with how the bundlers deal with `import.meta.url`:
   * ```js
   * new Worker(new URL('path-to-bundle.mjs', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' });
   * ```
   *
   * This will make the browser load the worker script correctly.
   *
   * Since we have multiple bundle outputs, we need to define this placeholder in the build definitions.
