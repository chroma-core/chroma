/**
 * <p>IAM Identity Center OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables a client (such as CLI or a
 *       native application) to register with IAM Identity Center. The service also enables the client to fetch the
 *       user’s access token upon successful authentication and authorization with IAM Identity Center.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>API namespaces</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>IAM Identity Center uses the <code>sso</code> and <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces. IAM Identity Center
 *       OpenID Connect uses the <code>sso-oidc</code> namespace.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Considerations for using this guide</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>Before you begin using this guide, we recommend that you first review the following
 *       important information about how the IAM Identity Center OIDC service works.</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently implements only the portions of the OAuth 2.0 Device
 *           Authorization Grant standard (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628</a>) that are necessary to enable single
 *           sign-on authentication with the CLI. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>With older versions of the CLI, the service only emits OIDC access tokens, so to
 *           obtain a new token, users must explicitly re-authenticate. To access the OIDC flow that
 *           supports token refresh and doesn’t require re-authentication, update to the latest CLI
 *           version (1.27.10 for CLI V1 and 2.9.0 for CLI V2) with support for OIDC token refresh
 *           and configurable IAM Identity Center session durations. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/configure-user-session.html">Configure Amazon Web Services access portal session duration </a>. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The access tokens provided by this service grant access to all Amazon Web Services account
 *           entitlements assigned to an IAM Identity Center user, not just a particular application.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The documentation in this guide does not describe the mechanism to convert the access
 *           token into Amazon Web Services Auth (“sigv4”) credentials for use with IAM-protected Amazon Web Services service
 *           endpoints. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/PortalAPIReference/API_GetRoleCredentials.html">GetRoleCredentials</a> in the <i>IAM Identity Center Portal API Reference
 *           Guide</i>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>For general information about IAM Identity Center, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What is
 *         IAM Identity Center?</a> in the <i>IAM Identity Center User Guide</i>.</p>
