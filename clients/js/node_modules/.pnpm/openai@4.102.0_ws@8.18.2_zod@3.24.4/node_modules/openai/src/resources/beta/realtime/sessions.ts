   * is more advanced and uses a turn detection model (in conjuction with VAD) to
   * semantically estimate whether the user has finished speaking, then dynamically
   * sets a timeout based on this probability. For example, if user audio trails off
   * with "uhhm", the model will score a low probability of turn end and wait longer
   * for the user to continue speaking. This can be useful for more natural
   * conversations, but may have a higher latency.
