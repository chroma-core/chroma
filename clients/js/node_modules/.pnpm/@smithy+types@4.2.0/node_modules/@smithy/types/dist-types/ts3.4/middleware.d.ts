     * - build: The input has been serialized into an HTTP request, but that

     *      will be applied to all retries. Examples of typical build tasks
     *      include injecting HTTP headers that describe a stable aspect of the
     *      request, such as `Content-Length` or a body checksum.
     * - finalizeRequest: The request is being prepared to be sent over the wire. The
     *      request in this stage should already be semantically complete and
     *      should therefore only be altered as match the recipient's
     *      expectations. Examples of typical finalization tasks include request
     *      signing and injecting hop-by-hop headers.
     * - deserialize: The response has arrived, the middleware here will deserialize
     *      the raw response object to structured response

 * A stack storing middleware. It can be resolved into a handler. It supports 2

 *    `priority` options to `high` or `low`.
 * 2. Adding middleware to location relative to known middleware with `addRelativeTo()`.
 *    This is useful when given middleware must be executed before or after specific
 *    middleware(`toMiddleware`). You can add a middleware relatively to another
 *    middleware which also added relatively. But eventually, this relative middleware
 *    chain **must** be 'anchored' by a middleware that added using `add()` API
 *    with absolute `step` and `priority`. This mothod will throw if specified
