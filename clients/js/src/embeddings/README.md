# Embeddings Function Definition

Embedding functions are used to transform text data into numerical representations, which are easier for machine learning models to process. Here's how you can define an embedding function.

## Step 1: Create a Folder for the Embeddings Function

First, you need to create a new folder inside `clients/js/src/embeddings`. This folder should be named after the embeddings organization. For example, if you're using embeddings from OpenAI, you might name the folder `openai`. 

For example, if you are creating your own embeddings function named `MyEmbeddings`, you should create a folder at `clients/js/src/embeddings/my-embeddings`.

## Step 2: Import the Interface

Next, inside this new folder, create a TypeScript file (for instance, `MyEmbeddingFunction.ts`) and import the `IEmbeddingFunction` interface from the appropriate module. This interface defines the structure that your embedding function should follow.

```typescript
import { IEmbeddingFunction } from "../IEmbeddingFunction";
```

## Step 3: Define Your Class

Now, you'll need to define a class that implements the `IEmbeddingFunction` interface. This class will contain the logic for your embedding function.

Here's an example of what this could look like:

```typescript
export class MyEmbeddingFunction implements IEmbeddingFunction {
  // Your code here
}
```

## Step 4: Implement the `generate` Method

The `IEmbeddingFunction` interface requires a `generate` method that takes an array of strings and returns a promise that resolves to a 2D array of numbers.

```typescript
public async generate(texts: string[]): Promise<number[][]> {
  // Your code here
}
```

In this method, you should implement the logic to transform the input texts into numerical representations. This will typically involve using some sort of machine learning model.

## Step 5: Export Your Class

Finally, export your class so that it can be imported and used elsewhere in your project.

```typescript
export { MyEmbeddingFunction };
```

## Step 6: Usage

After defining the embedding function, the build script in the `package.json` will generate files so that you can import it using the following syntax:

```typescript
import { MyEmbeddingFunction } from 'chromadb/my-embeddings';
```

## Conclusion

That's it! You've now defined an embedding function. This function can now be used to transform text data into a format that's suitable for machine learning models.

Remember, the specific logic in your `generate` method will depend on the machine learning model you're using and the specific requirements of your project.
