    "# Basic embedding retrieval with Chroma\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the most basic use of Chroma to store and retrieve information using embeddings. This core building block is at the heart of many powerful AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are the A.I-native way to represent any kind of data, making them the perfect fit for working with all kinds of A.I-powered tools and algorithms. They can represent text, images, and soon audio and video.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an embedding, data is fed into an embedding model, which outputs vectors of numbers. The model is trained in such a way that 'similar' data, e.g. text with similar meanings, or images with similar content, will produce vectors which are nearer to one another, than those which are dissimilar.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Embeddings and retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the similarity property of embeddings to search for and retrieve information. For example, we can find documents relevant to a particular topic, or images similar to a given image. Rather than searching for keywords or tags, we can search by finding data with similar semantic meaning.\n"

      "Question: What type of organism is commonly used in preparation of foods such as cheese and yogurt?\n",
      "Retrieved support: Bacteria can be used to make cheese from milk. The bacteria turn the milk sugars into lactic acid. The acid is what causes the milk to curdle to form cheese. Bacteria are also involved in producing other foods. Yogurt is made by using bacteria to ferment milk ( Figure below ). Fermenting cabbage with bacteria produces sauerkraut.\n",

      "Question: Changes from a less-ordered state to a more-ordered state (such as a liquid to a solid) are always what?\n",
      "Retrieved support: Solids that change to gases generally first pass through the liquid state. However, sometimes solids change directly to gases and skip the liquid state. The reverse can also occur. Sometimes gases change directly to solids.\n",

      "Question: When a meteoroid reaches earth, what is the remaining object called?\n",
      "Retrieved support: A meteoroid is dragged toward Earth by gravity and enters the atmosphere. Friction with the atmosphere heats the object quickly, so it starts to vaporize. As it flies through the atmosphere, it leaves a trail of glowing gases. The object is now a meteor. Most meteors vaporize in the atmosphere. They never reach Earth’s surface. Large meteoroids may not burn up entirely in the atmosphere. A small core may remain and hit Earth’s surface. This is called a meteorite .\n",

      "Question: What kind of a reaction occurs when a substance reacts quickly with oxygen?\n",
      "Retrieved support: A combustion reaction occurs when a substance reacts quickly with oxygen (O 2 ). You can see an example of a combustion reaction in Figure below . Combustion is commonly called burning. The substance that burns is usually referred to as fuel. The products of a combustion reaction include carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O). The reaction typically gives off heat and light as well. The general equation for a combustion reaction can be represented by:.\n",
