    "## Late Chunking\n",
    "Late chunking is a technique to leverage the modelâ€™s long-context capabilities for generating contextual chunk embeddings. Include `late_chunking=True` in your request to enable contextual chunked representation. When set to true, Jina AI API will concatenate all sentences in the input field and feed them as a single string to the model. Internally, the model embeds this long concatenated string and then performs late chunking, returning a list of embeddings that matches the size of the input list."

Normally, the model will not have the context to understand these are referring to Berlin, but with late chunking that context is now imbued with the other documents' embeddings.\n",

For example, if the first set of documents talks about Berlin, and the next refers to computer operating systems, it would be best to not contaminate one set of documents' context with the other."
