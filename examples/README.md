This folder will contain an ever-growing set of examples.

The key with examples is that they should *always* work. The failure mode of examples folders is that they get quickly deprecated.

Examples are:
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to maintain examples are __simple__
- Use case examples are fine, technology is better

```
folder structure
- basic_functionality - notebooks with simple walkthroughs
- advanced_functionality - notebooks with advanced walkthroughs
- deployments - how to deploy places
- use_with - chroma + ___, where ___ can be langchain, nextjs, etc
- data - common data for examples
```
