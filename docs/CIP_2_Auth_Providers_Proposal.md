# CIP-2: Auth Providers Proposal

## Status

Current Status: `Accepted`

## **Motivation**

Currently, Chroma does not provide any authentication mechanism. This CIP proposes to
add authentication abstractions and basic authentication mechanisms to Chroma.

There are intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for this CIP. The intrinsic motivation
is to provide a secure way to access Chroma as adoption grows and the team is gearing up to release a cloud offering.
The extrinsic motivation is driven by the community which is deploying Chroma in both public and private clouds and
in test and production environments. The community has expressed the need for authentication and authorization.

> Observation: We consider the Auth to be applicable to client-server mode.

## **Public Interfaces**

Changes to the public interface are related to the `Settings` class where we introduce new optional attributes to
control server and client-side auth providers.

## **Proposed Changes**

We propose two abstraction groups, one for the server-side and another for the client-side. In
addition we also introduce a FastAPI/startlette middleware adapter which will allow using the server-side abstractions
in the context of FastAPI. For client-side we rely on `requests`

### Constraints

This section provides the architectural constraints for the authentication framework. The constraints are set of
restrictions we impose to make the design simpler and more robust.

- There must be at most one active client-side auth provider
- There must be at most one active client-side credentials provider
- There must be at most one active server-side auth provider
- There must be at most one active server-side auth configuration provider
- There must be at most one active server-side auth credentials provider

### Core Concepts

- Auth Provider - an abstraction that provides authentication functionality for either client or server-side. The
  provider is responsible for validating client credentials using (if available) configuration and credentials
  providers. The auth provider is also responsible for carrying the Chroma-leg of any authentication flow.
- Auth Configuration Provider - an abstraction that provides configuration for auth providers. The configuration can be
  loaded from a file, env vars or programmatically. The configuration is used for validating and/or accessing user
  credentials. Examples: secret key for JWT token based auth, DB URL for DB based auth, etc. Depending on sensitivity of
  the information stored in the configuration, the provider should implement the necessary interfaces to access such
  information in a secure way.
- Auth Credentials Provider - an abstraction that provides credentials for auth providers. The credentials can be
  loaded from a file, env vars or programmatically. The credentials are used for validating client-side credentials (for
  sever-side auth) and retrieving or generating client-side credentials (for client-side auth).

#### Abstractions

##### Server-Side

We suggest multiple abstractions on the server-side to allow for easy integration with different auth providers.
We suggest the following abstractions:

> Note: All abstractions are defined under `chromadb.auth` package

- `ServerAuthProvider` - this is the base server auth provider abstraction that allows any server implementation of
  Chroma to support variety of auth providers. The main responsibility of the auth provider is to orchestrate the auth
  flow by gluing together the auth configuration and credentials providers.
- `ChromaAuthMiddleware` - The auth middleware is effectively an adapter responsible for providing server specific
  implementation of the auth middleware. This includes three general types of operations - forwarding authentication to
  the auth provider, instrumenting the server if needed to support a specific auth flow, ignore certain
  actions/operations (e.g. in REST this would be verb+path) that should not be authenticated.
- `ServerAuthenticationRequest` - An abstraction for querying for authentication data from server specific
  implementation.
- `ServerAuthenticationResponse` - An abstraction for returning authentication data to server specific implementation.
- `ServerAuthConfigurationProvider` - this is the base abstraction for auth configuration providers. The provider is
  responsible for loading auth configuration from a file, env vars or programmatically.
- `AbstractCredentials` - base abstraction for credentials encapsulation from server to Auth Credentials Provider.
- `ServerAuthCredentialsProvider` - this is the base abstraction for auth credentials providers. The provider is
  responsible for verifying client credentials.

##### Client-Side

We suggest multiple abstractions on the client-side to allow for easy integration with different auth providers.

- `ClientAuthProvider` - this is the base client auth provider abstraction that allows any client implementation of
  Chroma to support variety of auth providers. The main responsibility of the auth provider is to orchestrate the auth
  flow by gluing together the auth configuration and credentials providers, and any possible auth workflows (e.g. OAuth)
- `ClientAuthConfigurationProvider` - this is the base abstraction for auth configuration providers. The provider is
  responsible for loading auth configuration from a file, env vars or programmatically.
- `ClientAuthCredentialsProvider` - this is the base abstraction for auth credentials providers. The provider is
  responsible for verifying client credentials.
- `AbstractCredentials` - base abstraction for credentials encapsulation from client to Auth Credentials Provider.
- `ClientAuthProtocolAdapter` - this is an abstraction that allows for client-side auth providers to communicate with
  backends using variety of protocols and libraries (e.g. `requests`, `gRPC` etc). The adapter is responsible for
  translating the auth requests to generated by the credentials provider to a protocol specific message.

### Configuration

#### Client-side



### Reasoning

- Server-side abstraction - it is very useful as the intention is to support a variety of auth providers.
- Client-side abstraction - similar reasoning but from client's perspective. It will allow for both standard and
  non-standard auth provider plugins to be added without further impacting the client side
- Backend (fastAPI) adapter - this is a backend-specific way of loading server-side auth provider plugins. It will also
  serve as a template/blueprint when it comes to introducing the auth plugins to another backend framework (e.g. Flask)

We also propose that each auth provider on either side must be configurable via three main methods depending on
developer preference:

- File-base - a configuration file that provides the requisite config and credentials (recommended for production)
- Env - configuration through environment variables (this can also apply for the file-based config, which can be
  specified in env var)
- Programmatically - provide requisite configuration through CLI or directly in code (it is left for the developer to
  decide how such configuration is loaded and made available to the auth provider) - this is possibly the least secure
  and should be used for testing

The intention is to start with two minimal but useful Auth providers:

- Basic Auth - base64 encoded user and password credentials. The credentials will be static in nature and defined via
  auth provider config
- Token - A simple static token implementation

Both of the above providers will rely on the `Authorization` header to achieve their functionality.

> Both initial providers are there to help introduce a bear minimum security but are not recommended for production use

Further work:

- Introduction of JWT and mTLS auth providers
- API Keys
- Chroma managed user store - this would be similar to what standard DBMSâ€™ are doing today - maintain a table with users
  and salted password hashes
- K8s RBAC integration (for cloud-native deployments)
- GCP service accounts?
- SPIFFE and SPIRE integrations
- Go and Java client-side auth providers (for other impl like Rust and Ruby, we need to discuss with respective
  maintainers)

> Note: this CIP intentionally does not tackle authZ but acknowledges that authN and authZ must work in tandem in future
> releases

## **Compatibility, Deprecation, and Migration Plan**

This change, introducing a pluggable auth framework is not impacting compatibility of existing deployments and users can
upgrade and use the new framework without the need for migration.

No deprecations.

## **Test Plan**

We will introduce a new set of tests to verify both client and server-side auth providers.

## **Rejected Alternatives**

We have considered direct middleware Auth or existing third-party libraries for FastAPI integration with auth providers,
but that will create a dependency for Chroma on FastAPI itself.

We have also considered using OAuth 2.0 or OIDC however the challenge there is that both of these protocols are
generally intended for User (human) auth whereas in our case we have a system-to-system auth. That said there still
might be room for either of these protocols, but further more in-depth use case analysis is required.

Relying entirely on external providers, while this is possible not providing out-of-the-box integrated auth capabilities
is a non-starter for many enterprise customers.
