import { Callout } from '/snippets/callout.mdx';

The [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) is Google's open-source framework for building AI agents. Chroma integrates with ADK via the [Chroma MCP server](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma-mcp), giving your agents access to semantic memory, knowledge base retrieval, and persistent context across sessions.

## Example: Semantic Memory Agent

This example builds a personal assistant that uses Chroma as a persistent semantic memory store. The agent remembers facts from past conversations — user preferences, project context, decisions — and recalls them when relevant.

The agent's instruction tells it to create a Chroma collection for storing memories, and to use it for storage and retrieval:

```python Python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool import McpToolset
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StdioConnectionParams
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

CHROMA_TENANT = "your-tenant-id"
CHROMA_DATABASE = "my-adk-db"
CHROMA_API_KEY = "your-api-key"

MEMORY_INSTRUCTION = """You are a personal assistant with persistent memory.

You have access to Chroma tools for managing collections and documents.

## First run
On your first interaction, use chroma_create_collection to create a collection
called "memory". If it already exists, that's fine — just use the existing one.

## Storing memories
When the user shares important information — preferences, project details,
decisions, or personal context — store it in the "memory" collection using
chroma_add_documents. Each memory should be a concise, self-contained fact.
Tag memories with metadata like {"type": "preference"}, {"type": "fact"},
or {"type": "decision"} so they can be filtered later.

## Recalling memories
At the start of a conversation, or when the user asks about something that
might relate to past context, use chroma_query_documents to search the
"memory" collection. Use the results to inform your responses without
the user having to repeat themselves.

## Memory hygiene
If the user corrects a previous fact, use chroma_update_documents to update
the old memory rather than creating a duplicate.
"""

root_agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.5-pro",
    name="memory_agent",
    instruction=MEMORY_INSTRUCTION,

      DynamoDB. Our deadline is end of Q3 and the team lead is Sarah.

Agent: Got it, I've stored those project details. I'll remember them for
       future conversations.
       (creates "memory" collection, stores 3 memories: project description,
       deadline, team lead)

--- later session ---

User: What do you remember about my current project?

Agent: You're working on Project Atlas — a PostgreSQL to DynamoDB migration.
       Sarah is the team lead and your deadline is end of Q3.
       (retrieved via semantic search on "current project")
