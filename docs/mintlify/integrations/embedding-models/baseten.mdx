Chroma provides a convenient integration with any OpenAI-compatible embedding model deployed on Baseten. Every embedding model deployed with BEI is compatible with the OpenAI SDK.

Get started easily with an embedding model from Baseten's model library, like [Mixedbread Embed Large](https://www.baseten.co/library/mixedbread-embed-large-v1/).

## Using Baseten models with Chroma

This embedding function relies on the openai python package, which you can install with pip install openai.

You must set the api\_key and api\_base, replacing the api\_base with the URL from the model deployed in your Baseten account.

```python Python
import os
import chromadb.utils.embedding_functions as embedding_functions

baseten_ef = embedding_functions.BasetenEmbeddingFunction(
                api_key=os.environ["BASETEN_API_KEY"],
                api_base="https://model-xxxxxxxx.api.baseten.co/environments/production/sync/v1",
            )

baseten_ef(input=["This is my first text to embed", "This is my second document"])
```
