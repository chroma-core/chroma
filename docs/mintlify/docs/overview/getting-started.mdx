This guide is for developers who want to install Chroma and run their first semantic search query. By the end, you'll understand Chroma's core concepts and be able to store and query your own data.

## What is a Vector Database?

A **vector database** stores data as numerical vectors (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning. Unlike traditional databases that match exact keywords, vector databases find results based on *meaning*—so a search for "tropical fruit" can match documents about "pineapple" even if they don't share any words.

Chroma handles the complexity of embeddings for you: just add your text, and Chroma will embed, index, and enable semantic search automatically.

## Core Concepts

Before diving in, here are the key concepts you'll encounter:

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Client** | Your connection to Chroma. Can be in-memory, persistent, or cloud-based. |
| **Collection** | A named group of documents, like a table in a traditional database. |
| **Document** | The text you want to store and search. |
| **Embedding** | A numerical vector representing your document's meaning (Chroma generates these automatically). |
| **Query** | A search request that finds documents semantically similar to your input. |

</div>

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Python | 3.9+ | Check with `python --version` |
| pip | Latest | Usually included with Python |
| SQLite | 3.35+ | Included in Python 3.10+. [Troubleshoot older versions](/docs/overview/troubleshooting#sqlite) |

<Callout title="Recommended">
Use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts:
```bash
python -m venv chroma-env && source chroma-env/bin/activate
```
</Callout>

### Quick Start

<Steps titleSize="h4">
  <Step title="Install Chroma">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash pip
    pip install chromadb
    ```
    ```bash poetry
    poetry add chromadb
    ```
    ```bash uv
    uv pip install chromadb
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Client">
    The in-memory client is the fastest way to get started. Data is stored in memory and will be lost when your program exits.

    ```python
    import chromadb

    client = chromadb.Client()
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Collection">
    Collections store your documents and their embeddings.

    ```python
    collection = client.create_collection(name="my_collection")
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Documents">
    Add your text documents with unique IDs. Chroma automatically generates embeddings.

    ```python
    collection.add(
        ids=["id1", "id2"],
        documents=[
            "This is a document about pineapple",
            "This is a document about oranges"
        ]
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Query">
    Search for documents similar to your query text.

    ```python
    results = collection.query(
        query_texts=["This is a query document about hawaii"],
        n_results=2
    )
    print(results)
    ```

    **Expected Output:**
    ```python
    {
        'ids': [['id1', 'id2']],
        'documents': [[
            'This is a document about pineapple',
            'This is a document about oranges'
        ]],
        'distances': [[1.0404009819030762, 1.243080496788025]],
        'metadatas': [[None, None]],
        'embeddings': None,
        'uris': None,
        'data': None
    }
    ```

    Notice that "pineapple" (id1) has a smaller distance than "oranges" (id2) — it's more semantically similar to "hawaii"!
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Complete Example

Copy and run this complete script to verify your installation:

```python
import chromadb

# Create an in-memory client
client = chromadb.Client()

# Create a collection (use get_or_create_collection to avoid errors on re-runs)
collection = client.get_or_create_collection(name="my_collection")

# Add documents (use upsert to avoid duplicates on re-runs)
collection.upsert(
    ids=["id1", "id2", "id3"],
    documents=[
        "This is a document about pineapple",
        "This is a document about oranges",
        "This is a document about airplanes"
    ]
)

# Query for documents about tropical topics
results = collection.query(
    query_texts=["tropical fruit"],
    n_results=2
)

print("Query: 'tropical fruit'")
print(f"Results: {results['documents'][0]}")
print(f"Distances: {results['distances'][0]}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Query: 'tropical fruit'
Results: ['This is a document about pineapple', 'This is a document about oranges']
Distances: [1.2534053325653076, 1.3506293296813965]
```

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Node.js | 18+ | Check with `node --version` |
| npm/pnpm/yarn/bun | Latest | Any package manager works |

<Callout title="Important">
The TypeScript client requires a running Chroma server. You can start one using the CLI or Docker (see Step 2 below).
</Callout>

### Quick Start

<Steps titleSize="h4">
  <Step title="Install the Package">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm install chromadb @chroma-core/default-embed
    ```
    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add chromadb @chroma-core/default-embed
    ```
    ```bash yarn
    yarn add chromadb @chroma-core/default-embed
    ```
    ```bash bun
    bun add chromadb @chroma-core/default-embed
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Chroma Server">
    In a separate terminal, start the Chroma backend:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash CLI
    npx chroma run --path ./chroma-data
    ```
    ```bash Docker
    docker run -p 8000:8000 chromadb/chroma
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`. Keep this terminal running.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Client">
    Connect to your running Chroma server:

    ```typescript
    import { ChromaClient } from "chromadb";

    const client = new ChromaClient();
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Collection">
    Collections store your documents and their embeddings.

    ```typescript
    const collection = await client.createCollection({
      name: "my_collection",
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Documents">
    Add your text documents with unique IDs. Chroma automatically generates embeddings.

    ```typescript
    await collection.add({
      ids: ["id1", "id2"],
      documents: [
        "This is a document about pineapple",
        "This is a document about oranges",
      ],
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Query">
    Search for documents similar to your query text.

    ```typescript
    const results = await collection.query({
      queryTexts: "This is a query document about hawaii",
      nResults: 2,
    });

    console.log(results);
    ```

    **Expected Output:**
    ```typescript
    {
      ids: [['id1', 'id2']],
      documents: [[
        'This is a document about pineapple',
        'This is a document about oranges'
      ]],
      distances: [[1.0404009819030762, 1.243080496788025]],
      metadatas: [[null, null]],
      embeddings: null
    }
    ```

    Notice that "pineapple" (id1) has a smaller distance than "oranges" (id2) — it's more semantically similar to "hawaii"!
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Complete Example

Save this as `index.ts` and run with `npx ts-node index.ts` (or your preferred TypeScript runner):

```typescript
import { ChromaClient } from "chromadb";

async function main() {
  // Connect to the Chroma server
  const client = new ChromaClient();

  // Create a collection (use getOrCreateCollection to avoid errors on re-runs)
  const collection = await client.getOrCreateCollection({
    name: "my_collection",
  });

  // Add documents (use upsert to avoid duplicates on re-runs)
  await collection.upsert({
    ids: ["id1", "id2", "id3"],
    documents: [
      "This is a document about pineapple",
      "This is a document about oranges",
      "This is a document about airplanes",
    ],
  });

  // Query for documents about tropical topics
  const results = await collection.query({
    queryTexts: ["tropical fruit"],
    nResults: 2,
  });

  console.log("Query: 'tropical fruit'");
  console.log("Results:", results.documents?.[0]);
  console.log("Distances:", results.distances?.[0]);
}

main();
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Query: 'tropical fruit'
Results: ['This is a document about pineapple', 'This is a document about oranges']
Distances: [1.2534053325653076, 1.3506293296813965]
```

<Callout title="Using Next.js?">
If you encounter bundling issues with Next.js, wrap your config with `withChroma`. See [Troubleshooting](/docs/overview/troubleshooting#chroma-js-client-failures-on-nextjs-projects) for details.
