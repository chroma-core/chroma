**Chroma is the open-source AI application database**. Chroma makes it easy to build LLM apps by making knowledge, facts, and skills pluggable for LLMs.

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas.

### Getting Started

Here are some helpful links to get you started with contributing to Chroma

- The Chroma codebase is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma)
- Issues are tracked on [Github Issues](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/issues). Please report any issues you find there making sure to fill out the correct [form for the type of issue you are reporting](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/issues/new/choose).
- In order to run Chroma locally you can follow the [Development Instructions](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/blob/main/DEVELOP.md).
- If you want to contribute and aren't sure where to get started you can search for issues with the [Good first issue](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) tag.
- The Chroma documentation (including this page!) is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/tree/main/docs) as well. If you find any issues with the documentation please report them on the Github Issues page for [the documentation](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/issues).

### Contributing Code and Ideas

#### Feature Requests

Feature requests and proposals for large changes to Chroma should be submitted using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/issues). If you want to suggest a new feature or a major change, please open an issue and select the relevant template. This allows the core Chroma team and the community to discuss and provide feedback directly in the issue. For smaller changes like bug fixes or documentation updates, you can submit an issue or open a pull request as usual.

Once proposed, the issue will be reviewed by the Chroma team and its status will be tracked in GitHub. We use labels and issue states to indicate the progress of the proposal—for example, whether it is under review, accepted, being implemented, or closed. For more information, see our GitHub Issues page and contribution guidelines.

You can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/MMeYNTmh3x) and chat with us in the [#feature-ideas](https://discord.com/channels/1073293645303795742/1131592310786887700) channel. We are always happy to discuss new ideas and features with the community.

#### Pull Requests

In order to submit a change to Chroma please submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/compare) against Chroma or the documentation. The pull request will be reviewed by the Chroma team and if approved, will be merged into the repository. We will do our best to review pull requests in a timely manner but please be patient as we are a small team. We will work to integrate your proposed changes as quickly as possible if they align with the goals of the project. We ask that you label your pull request with a title prefix that indicates the type of change you are proposing. The following prefixes are used:

```text
ENH: Enhancement, new functionality
BUG: Bug fix
DOC: Additions/updates to documentation
TST: Additions/updates to tests
BLD: Updates to the build process/scripts
PERF: Performance improvement
TYP: Type annotations
CLN: Code cleanup
CHORE: Maintenance and other tasks that do not modify source or test files
```

## Roadmap

You can track our progress on the Chroma project on the [changelog](https://www.trychroma.com/changelog).

Chroma is built and maintained by a small core team, so we are intentional about
where we invest engineering effort. Chroma has two deployment modes—distributed
Chroma and single-node local Chroma—which currently rely on different storage
subsystems. The database is and will always remain open-source (Apache 2.0), and
our cloud offering simply runs the same open-source distributed system.

Today, the majority of our engineering effort is focused on distributed Chroma
and the cloud offering. As a result, local Chroma may temporarily lack some
features or behaviors available in the distributed system. Restoring and
maintaining 100% feature and API parity remains an active goal, and unifying the
underlying storage systems is a key part of that work.

## Telemetry

Chroma contains a telemetry feature that collects **anonymous** usage information.

### Why?

We use this information to help us understand how Chroma is used, to help us prioritize work on new features and bug fixes, and to help us improve Chroma's performance and stability.

### Opting out

If you prefer to opt out of telemetry, you can do this in two ways.

#### In Client Code

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python" icon="python">

Set `anonymized_telemetry` to `False` in your client's settings:

```python
from chromadb.config import Settings
client = chromadb.Client(Settings(anonymized_telemetry=False))
# or if using PersistentClient
client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="/path/to/save/to", settings=Settings(anonymized_telemetry=False))
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript" icon="js">

Disable telemetry on your Chroma server (see next section) via environment variables where you run Chroma.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Rust" icon="rust">

Disable telemetry on your Chroma server (see next section) via environment variables where you run Chroma.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### In Chroma's Backend Server Using Environment Variables

Set `ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY` to `False` in your shell or server environment.

If you are running Chroma on your local computer with `docker-compose` you can set this value in an `.env` file placed in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```text
ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False
```

### What do you track?

We will only track usage details that help us make product decisions, specifically:

- Chroma version and environment details (e.g. OS, Python version, is it running in a container, or in a jupyter notebook)
- Usage of embedding functions that ship with Chroma and aggregated usage of custom embeddings (we collect no information about the custom embeddings themselves)
- Client interactions with our hosted Chroma Cloud service.
- Collection commands. We track the anonymized uuid of a collection as well as the number of items
  - `add`
  - `update`
  - `query`
  - `get`
  - `delete`

We **do not** collect personally-identifiable or sensitive information, such as: usernames, hostnames, file names, environment variables, or hostnames of systems being tested.

To view the list of events we track, you may reference the **[code](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/blob/main/chromadb/telemetry/product/events.py)**

### Where is telemetry information stored?

We use **[Posthog](https://posthog.com/)** to store and visualize telemetry data.
