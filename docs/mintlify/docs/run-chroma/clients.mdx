There are several ways you can instantiate clients to connect to your Chroma database.

## Cloud Client

You can use the `CloudClient` to create a client connecting to Chroma Cloud.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import chromadb

client = chromadb.CloudClient(
    tenant='Tenant ID',
    database='Database name',
    api_key='Chroma Cloud API key'
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { CloudClient } from "chromadb";

const client = new CloudClient({
  tenant: "Tenant ID",
  database: "Database name",
  apiKey: "Chroma Cloud API key",
});
```
</CodeGroup>

The `CloudClient` can be instantiated just with the API key argument. In which case, we will resolve the tenant and DB from Chroma Cloud. Note our auto-resolution will work only if the provided API key is scoped to a single DB.

If you set the `CHROMA_API_KEY`, `CHROMA_TENANT`, and the `CHROMA_DATABASE` environment variables, you can simply instantiate a `CloudClient` with no arguments:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
client = chromadb.CloudClient()
```

```typescript TypeScript
const client = new CloudClient();
```
</CodeGroup>

## In-Memory Client

In Python, you can run a Chroma server in-memory and connect to it with the ephemeral client:

```python
import chromadb

client = chromadb.Client()
```

The `Client()` method starts a Chroma server in-memory and also returns a client with which you can connect to it.

This is a great tool for experimenting with different embedding functions and retrieval techniques in a Python notebook, for example. If you don't need data persistence, the ephemeral client is a good choice for getting up and running with Chroma.

## Persistent Client

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python" icon="python">

You can configure Chroma to save and load the database from your local machine, using the `PersistentClient`.

Data will be persisted automatically and loaded on start (if it exists).

```python
import chromadb

client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="/path/to/save/to")
```

The `path` is where Chroma will store its database files on disk, and load them on start. If you don't provide a path, the default is `.chroma`

The client object has a few useful convenience methods.

- `heartbeat()` - returns a nanosecond heartbeat. Useful for making sure the client remains connected.
- `reset()` - empties and completely resets the database. WARNING: This is destructive and not reversible.

```python
client.heartbeat()
client.reset()
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript" icon="js">

To connect with the JS/TS client, you must connect to a Chroma server.

To run a Chroma server locally that will persist your data, install Chroma from npm using any npm compatible client.

```terminal
npm install chromadb
```

And run the server using our CLI:

```terminal
npx chroma run --path ./getting-started
```

The `path` is where Chroma will store its database files on disk, and load them on start. The default is `.chroma`.

Alternatively, you can also use our official Docker image:

```terminal
docker pull chromadb/chroma
docker run -p 8000:8000 chromadb/chroma
```

With a Chroma server running locally, you can connect to it by instantiating a new `ChromaClient`:

```typescript
import { ChromaClient } from "chromadb";

const client = new ChromaClient();
```

By default, the `ChromaClient` is wired to connect to a Chroma server at `http://localhost:8000`, with `default_tenant` and `default_database`. If you have different settings you can provide them to the `ChromaClient` constructor:

```typescript
const client = new ChromaClient({
  ssl: false,
  host: "localhost",
  port: 9000, // non-standard port based on your server config
  database: "my-db",
  headers: {},
});
```

The client object has a few useful convenience methods.

- `heartbeat()` - returns a nanosecond heartbeat. Useful for making sure the client remains connected.
- `reset()` - empties and completely resets the database. WARNING: This is destructive and not reversible.

```typescript
await client.heartbeat();
await client.reset();
```
