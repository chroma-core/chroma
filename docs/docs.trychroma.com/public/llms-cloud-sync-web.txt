Web Sync allows you to easily sync content from any publicly accessible website into your Chroma Cloud database. Given a starting URL, Sync will crawl the website and its links up to a specified depth, extracting the content as Markdown, chunking it, and inserting it into your Chroma database with embeddings.

After it finishes, you'll be redirected to the created collection.
