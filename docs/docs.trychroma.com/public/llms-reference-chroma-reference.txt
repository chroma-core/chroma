# Chroma Reference

## Client APIs

Chroma currently maintains 1st party clients for Python and Javascript. For other clients in other languages, use their repos for documentation.

`Client` - is the object that wraps a connection to a backing Chroma DB

`Collection` - is the object that wraps a collection
