# Chonkie
[Chonkie](https://docs.chonkie.ai) is an open library for data ingestion. Chonkie provides advanced chunkers for cleanly splitting your data, and embedding handlers to embed the resulting chunks.

When building a RAG system, you can have your data chunked and embeded by Chonkie, and then pass it on to the Chroma handshake for storage and retreival from your Chroma instance.
