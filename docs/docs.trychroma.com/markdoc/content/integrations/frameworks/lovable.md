# Lovable.dev

[Lovable.dev](https://www.lovable.dev) is a versatile platform designed to help developers quickly build and deploy AI-powered applications. Whether you're working on search engines, recommendation systems, or any other type of AI-driven project, Lovable.dev makes it easy to integrate advanced AI models and manage your data efficiently.

## Using ChromaDB for Vector Storage

Lovable.dev allows you to integrate [ChromaDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromadb), a powerful vector storage solution, to store and manage vector embeddings. ChromaDB is designed to handle embeddings and other high-dimensional data efficiently, making it ideal for a wide range of AI applications.

To get started with ChromaDB for vector storage, input the following prompt into Lovable.dev:

### Input Prompt:
```
Build an application utilizing ChromaDB (https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromadb) as storage
```

### What Happens When You Enter the Prompt:
Upon submitting the above prompt, Lovable.dev will automatically generate the necessary code and architecture to create a simple **chat application** that demonstrates how to use the ChromaDB SDK. This application will showcase how to:

1. **Store User Messages and Responses**: The chat app will store user inputs and relevant responses as vector embeddings in ChromaDB.
2. **Query Vector Data**: The app will use ChromaDB to query stored embeddings for relevant information or past messages to generate a contextually relevant response.
3. **Retrieve Information**: The chat application will retrieve relevant vector data from ChromaDB based on the user's input, demonstrating how to leverage ChromaDB's efficient retrieval capabilities.

This simple chat app serves as a great starting point for developers looking to explore how ChromaDB works in practice, especially for applications that rely on vector storage and similarity search.

Once you input the prompt, you'll be ready to deploy your own AI-powered application with ChromaDB.
