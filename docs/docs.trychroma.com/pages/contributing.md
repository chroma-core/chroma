## Contributing Code and Ideas

### Pull Requests
In order to submit a change to Chroma please submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/compare) against Chroma or the documentation. The pull request will be reviewed by the Chroma team and if approved will be merged into the repository. We will do our best to review pull requests in a timely manner but please be patient as we are a small team. We will work to integrate your prpoosed changes as quickly as possible if they align with the goals of the project. We ask that you label your pull request with a title prefix that indicates the type of change you are proposing. The following prefixes are used:

```
ENH: Enhancement, new functionality
BUG: Bug fix
DOC: Additions/updates to documentation
TST: Additions/updates to tests
BLD: Updates to the build process/scripts
PERF: Performance improvement
TYP: Type annotations
CLN: Code cleanup
CHORE: Maintenance and other tasks that do not modify source or test files
```


### CIPs
Chroma Improvement Proposals or CIPs (pronounced "Chips") are the way to propose new features or large changes to Chroma. If you plan to make a large change to Chroma please submit a CIP first so that the core Chroma team as well as the community can discuss the proposed change and provide feedback. A CIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for why it is needed. The CIP should be submitted as a pull request to the [CIPs folder](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/tree/main/docs). The CIP will be reviewed by the Chroma team and if approved will be merged into the repository. To learn more about writing a CIP you can read the [guide](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/blob/main/docs/cip/CIP_Chroma_Improvment_Proposals.md). CIPs are not required for small changes such as bug fixes or documentation updates.

A CIP starts in the "Proposed" state, then moves to "Under Review" once the Chroma team has reviewed it and is considering it for implementation. Once the CIP is approved it will move to the "Accepted" state and the implementation can begin. Once the implementation is complete the CIP will move to the "Implemented" state. If the CIP is not approved it will move to the "Rejected" state. If the CIP is withdrawn by the author it will move to the "Withdrawn" state.


### Discord
