You can run Chroma single-node in [client/server mode](/deployment/client-server-mode), and easily deploy it. In this section, we also show you how to make sure your Chroma server is secure and reliable, and how to understand its performance at scale.

If you are using Chroma in production, please fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/appqd02UuQXCK5AuY/pagr1D0NFQoNpUpNZ/form), and we will add you to a dedicated Slack workspace for supporting production users. We would love to help you think through the design of your system, or if you would be a good fit for our upcoming distributed cloud service.
