## Client APIs

Chroma currently maintains 1st party clients for Python and Javascript. For other clients in other languages, use their repos for documentation.

`Client` - is the object that wraps a connection to a backing Chroma DB

`Collection` - is the object that wraps a collection


{% special_table %}
{% /special_table %}

|              | Client | Collection |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| Python | [Client](/reference/py-client) | [Collection](/reference/py-collection) |
| Javascript | [Client](/reference/js-client)   | [Collection](/reference/js-collection) |
