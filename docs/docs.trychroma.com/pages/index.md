Chroma is AI-native, meaning it has been designed from the ground up to power AI applications. Chroma makes it simple for you to store and retrieve data that is most relevant to your queries, ensuring your LLM has the information it needs to provide accurate and context-aware answers.

Chroma gives you the tools for: (* note - could link to documentation here?)
- **Vector search** - Use embeddings to search for similar documents or data points
- **Full-text search** - Search stored documents based on their content
- **Metadata search** - Search stored documents based on their metadata
- **Combined Search** - Find similar documents subject to full-text and metadata constraints

Chroma prioritizes:
- **Simplicity and developer productivity** – Chroma's default functionality lets you get up and running quickly with minimal code.
- **Portability** – Chroma can run locally on your machine in many different languages, with a hosted version coming soon
- **Efficiency** - Chroma is lightweight and fast!

Chroma runs where you need it: (* note - could link to example here?)
- in a Jupyter notebook
- in a Python script
- as a single-node server
- as a distributed cluster
