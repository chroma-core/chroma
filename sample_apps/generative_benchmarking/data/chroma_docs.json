Javascript/Typescript support coming soon! \n{% /Banner %}\n\nChroma supports multimodal collections, i.e. collections which can store, and can be queried by, multiple modalities of data.\n\n[Try it out in Colab](https://githubtocolab.com/chroma-core/chroma/blob/main/examples/multimodal/multimodal_retrieval.ipynb)\n\n## Multi-modal Embedding Functions\n\nChroma supports multi-modal embedding functions, which can be used to embed data from multiple modalities into a single embedding space.\n\nChroma has the OpenCLIP embedding function built in, which supports both text and images.\n\n```python\nfrom chromadb.utils.embedding_functions import OpenCLIPEmbeddingFunction\nembedding_function = OpenCLIPEmbeddingFunction()\n```\n\n## Data Loaders\n\nChroma supports data loaders, for storing and querying with data stored outside Chroma itself, via URI. Chroma will not store this data, but will instead store the URI, and load the data from the URI when needed.\n\nChroma has a data loader for loading images from a filesystem built in.\n\n```python\nfrom",
    "e39bb547-ec5a-4b04-bb10-69361dd66c39": " chromadb.utils.data_loaders import ImageLoader\ndata_loader = ImageLoader()\n```\n\n## Multi-modal Collections\n\nYou can create a multi-modal collection by passing in a multi-modal embedding function. In order to load data from a URI, you must also pass in a data loader.\n\n```python\nimport chromadb\n\nclient = chromadb.Client()\n\ncollection = client.create_collection(\n    name='multimodal_collection',\n    embedding_function=embedding_function,\n    data_loader=data_loader)\n\n```\n\n### Adding data\n\nYou can add data to a multi-modal collection by specifying the data modality. For now, images are supported:\n\n```python\ncollection.add(\n    ids=['id1', 'id2', 'id3'],\n    images=[...] # A list of numpy arrays representing images\n)\n```\n\nNote that Chroma will not store the data for you, and you will have to maintain a mapping from IDs to data yourself.\n\nHowever, you can use Chroma in combination with data stored elsewhere, by adding it via URI. Note that this requires that you have specified a data loader when creating the collection.\n\n```python\ncollection.add(\n    ids=['id1', 'id2', 'id3'],\n    uris=[...] #",
    "e616ec9c-2223-4d25-87c8-73540a747ed5": "  A list of strings representing URIs to data\n)\n```\n\nSince the embedding function is multi-modal, you can also add text to the same collection:\n\n```python\ncollection.add(\n    ids=['id4', 'id5', 'id6'],\n    documents=[\"This is a document\", \"This is another document\", \"This is a third document\"]\n)\n```\n\n### Querying\n\nYou can query a multi-modal collection with any of the modalities that it supports. For example, you can query with images:\n\n```python\nresults = collection.query(\n    query_images=[...] # A list of numpy arrays representing images\n)\n```\n\nOr with text:\n\n```python\nresults = collection.query(\n    query_texts=[\"This is a query document\", \"This is another query document\"]\n)\n```\n\nIf a data loader is set for the collection, you can also query with URIs which reference data stored elsewhere of the supported modalities:\n\n```python\nresults = collection.query(\n    query_uris=[...] # A list of strings representing URIs to data\n)\n```\n\nAdditionally, if a data loader is set for the collection, and URIs are available, you can include the data in the results:\n\n```python\nresults",
    "3ff9f5dc-e4e1-406a-80dc-f9123a07466b": " = collection.query(\n    query_images=[...], # # list of numpy arrays representing images\n    includes=['data']\n)\n```\n\nThis will automatically call the data loader for any available URIs, and include the data in the results. `uris` are also available as an `includes` field.\n\n### Updating\n\nYou can update a multi-modal collection by specifying the data modality, in the same way as `add`. For now, images are supported:\n\n```python\ncollection.update(\n    ids=['id1', 'id2', 'id3'],\n    images=[...] # A list of numpy arrays representing images\n)\n```\n\nNote that a given entry with a specific ID can only have one associated modality at a time. Updates will over-write the existing modality, so for example, an entry which originally has corresponding text and updated with an image, will no longer have that text after an update with images.\n",

By storing these in Chroma Cloud, team members can use Claude to quickly access and learn from past support cases.\n\nFirst, set up your shared knowledge base:\n\n```python\nimport chromadb\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Connect to Chroma Cloud\nclient = chromadb.HttpClient(\n    ssl=True,\n    host='api.trychroma.com',\n    tenant='your-tenant-id',\n    database='support-kb',\n    headers={\n        'x-chroma-token': 'YOUR_API_KEY'\n    }\n)\n\n# Create a collection for support cases\ncollection = client.create_collection(\"support_cases\")\n\n# Add some example support cases\nsupport_cases = [\n    {\n        \"case\": \"Customer reported issues connecting their IoT devices to the dashboard.\",\n        \"resolution\": \"Guided customer through firewall configuration and port forwarding setup.\",\n        \"category\": \"connectivity\",\n        \"date\": \"2024-03-15\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"case\": \"User couldn't access admin features after recent update.\",\n        \"resolution\": \"Discovered role permissions weren't migrated correctly. Applied fix",
    "c4666bba-41ea-4f3c-b134-49e52024b871": " and documented process.\",\n        \"category\": \"permissions\",\n        \"date\": \"2024-03-16\"\n    }\n]\n\n# Add documents to collection\ncollection.add(\n    documents=[case[\"case\"] + \"\\n\" + case[\"resolution\"] for case in support_cases],\n    metadatas=[{\n        \"category\": case[\"category\"],\n        \"date\": case[\"date\"]\n    } for case in support_cases],\n    ids=[f\"case_{i}\" for i in range(len(support_cases))]\n)\n```\n\nNow team members can use Claude to access this knowledge.\n\nIn your claude config, add the following:\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chroma\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"chroma-mcp\",\n        \"--client-type\",\n        \"cloud\",\n        \"--tenant\",\n        \"your-tenant-id\",\n        \"--database\",\n        \"support-kb\",\n        \"--api-key\",\n        \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow you can use the knowledge base in your chats:\n```\nClaude, I'm having trouble helping a customer with IoT device connectivity.\nCan you check our support knowledge",

Consider the context and solutions from similar past issues\n3. Provide recommendations based on previous successful resolutions\n\nThis setup is particularly powerful because:\n- All support team members have access to the same knowledge base\n- Claude can learn from the entire team's experience\n- Solutions are standardized across the organization\n- New team members can quickly get up to speed on common issues\n\n### Project Memory Example\n\nClaude's context window has limits - long conversations eventually get truncated, and chats don't persist between sessions. Using Chroma as an external memory store solves these limitations, allowing Claude to reference past conversations and maintain context across multiple sessions.\n\nFirst, tell Claude to use Chroma for memory as part of the project setup:\n```\nRemember, you have access to Chroma tools.\nAt any point if the user references previous chats or memory, check chroma for similar conversations.\nTry to use retrieved information where possible.\n```\n\n![mcp-instructions](/mcp-instructions.png)\n\nThis prompt instructs Claude to:\n- Proactively check Chroma when memory-related topics come up\n- Search for semantically similar",

Break the conversation into smaller chunks (typically 512-1024 tokens)\n   - Chunking is necessary because:\n   - Large texts are harder to search semantically\n   - Smaller chunks help retrieve more precise context\n   - It prevents token limits in future retrievals\n2. Generate embeddings for each chunk\n3. Add metadata like timestamps and detected topics\n4. Store everything in your Chroma collection\n\n![mcp-store](/mcp-store.png)\n\nLater, you can access past conversations naturally:\n```\nWhat did we discuss previously about the authentication system?\n```\n\nClaude will:\n1. Search Chroma for chunks semantically related to authentication\n2. Filter by timestamp metadata for last week's discussions\n3. Incorporate the relevant historical context into its response\n\n![mcp-search](/mcp-search.png)\n\nThis setup is particularly useful for:\n- Long-running projects where context gets lost\n- Teams where multiple people interact with Claude\n- Complex discussions that reference past decisions\n- Maint",

Performance has significantly improved across the board.\n\n**Breaking changes**\n\nChroma no longer provides built-in authentication implementations.\n\n**Chroma in-process changes**\n\nThis section is applicable to you if you use Chroma via\n\n```python\n",

For example:\n\n```terminal\nchroma run --config ./config.yaml\n```\n\nCheck out a full sample configuration file [here](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/blob/main/rust/frontend/sample_configs/single_node_full.yaml).\n\n\n**Chroma in Docker changes**\n\nThis section is applicable to you if you run Chroma using a Docker container.\n\nSettings that you previously provided to the container using environment variables, like `CHROMA_SERVER_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` or `CHROMA_OT",
    "5a4fcd4a-b1bb-4d9f-afa3-e1bfb2b2da9b": "EL_COLLECTION_ENDPOINT`, are now provided to the container using a configuration file. See the [Docker documentation](../production/containers/docker#configuration) for more information.\n\nThe default data location in the container has changed from `/chroma/chroma` to `/data`. For example, if you previously started the container with:\n\n```terminal\ndocker run -p 8000:8000 -v ./chroma:/chroma/chroma chroma-core/chroma\n```\n\nyou should now start it with:\n\n```terminal\ndocker run -p 8000:8000 -v ./chroma:/data chroma-core/chroma\n```\n\n\n### v0.6.0\n\nPreviously, `list_collections` returned a list of `Collection` objects. This could lead to some errors if any of your collections were created with a custom embedding function (i.e. not the default). So moving forward, `list_collections` will only return collections names.\n\nFor example, if you created all your collections with the `OpenAIEmbeddingFunction` , this is how you will use `list_collections` and `get_collection` correctly:\n\n```python\ncollection_names = client.list_collections()\nef = OpenAIEmbeddingFunction(...)\ncollections =",
    "579df900-4665-4ef2-97b1-b4810743c085": " [\n\tclient.get_collection(name=name, embedding_function=ef)\n\tfor name in collection_names\n]\n```\n\nIn the future, we plan on supporting embedding function persistence, so `list_collections` can return properly configured `Collection` objects, and you won\u2019t need to supply the correct embedding function to `get_collection`.\n\nAdditionally, we have dropped support for Python 3.8\n\n### v0.5.17\n\nWe no longer support sending empty lists or dictionaries for metadata filtering, ID filtering, etc. For example,\n\n```python\ncollection.get(\n\tids=[\"id1\", \"id2\", \"id3\", ...],\n\twhere={}\n)\n```\n\nis not supported. Instead, use:\n\n```python\ncollection.get(ids=[\"id1\", \"id2\", \"id3\", ...])\n```\n\n### v0.5.12\n\nThe operators `$ne` (not equal) and `$nin` (not in) in `where` clauses have been updated:\n* Previously: They only matched records that had the specified key.\n* Now: They also match records that don't have the specified key at all.\n\nIn other words, `$ne` and `$nin` now match the complement set of records (the exact opposite) that",
    "a852f5d6-597b-435e-85df-d7633d154682": " `$eq` (equals) and `$in` (in) would match, respectively.\n\nThe `$not_contains` operator in the `where_document` clause has also been updated:\n* Previously: It only matched records that had a document field.\n* Now: It also matches records that don't have a document field at all.\n\nIn other words, `$not_contains` now matches the exact opposite set of records that `$contains` would match.\n\n`RateLimitingProvider` is now deprecated and replaced by `RateLimitEnforcer`. This new interface allows you to wrap server calls with rate limiting logic. The default `SimpleRateLimitEnforcer` implementation allows all requests, but you can create custom implementations for more advanced rate limiting strategies.\n### v0.5.11\n\nThe results returned by `collection.get()` is now ordered by internal ids. Whereas previously, the results were ordered by user provided ids, although this behavior was not explicitly documented.

For example, if you have a collection named `coll` of documents with ids `[\"3\", \"2\", \"1\", \"0\"]` inserted in this order, then previously `coll.get(limit=2, offset=2)[\"ids\"]` gives you `[\"2\", \"3\"]`, while currently this will give you `[\"1\", \"0\"]`.\n\nWe have also modified the behavior of `client.get_or_create`. Previously, if a collection already existed and the `metadata` argument was provided, the existing collection's metadata would be overwritten with the new values. This has now changed. If the collection already exists, get_or_create will simply return the existing collection with the specified name, and any additional arguments\u2014including `metadata`\u2014will be ignored.\n\nFinally, the embeddings returned from `collection.get()`, `collection.query()`, and `collection.peek()` are now represented as 2-dimensional NumPy arrays instead of Python lists. When adding embeddings, you can still use either a Python list or a NumPy array. If your request returns multiple embeddings, the result will be a Python list containing 2-dimensional NumPy arrays.

If you are using Chroma's built-in embedding functions, you do not need to take any action.\n\n**EmbeddingFunction**\n\nPreviously, `EmbeddingFunction`s were defined as:\n\n```python\nclass EmbeddingFunction(Protocol):\n    def __call__(self, texts: Documents) -> Embeddings:\n        ...\n```\n\nAfter this update, `EmbeddingFunction`s are defined as:\n\n```python\nEmbeddable = Union[Documents, Images]\nD = TypeVar(\"D\", bound=Embeddable, contravariant=True)\n\nclass EmbeddingFunction(Protocol[D]):\n    def __call__(self, input: D) -> Embeddings:\n        ...\n```\n\nThe key differences are:\n\n- `EmbeddingFunction` is now generic, and takes a type parameter `D` which is a subtype of `Embeddable`. This allows us to define `EmbeddingFunction`s which can embed multiple modalities.\n- `",

    "cfce40b3-e50d-4530-a598-0ee73799886d": "Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index to perform approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search for a given embedding. In this context, **Recall** refers to how many of the true nearest neighbors were retrieved.\n\nIncreasing `search_ef` normally improves recall, but slows down query time. Similarly, increasing `construction_ef` improves recall, but increases the memory usage and runtime when creating the index.\n\nChoosing the right values for your HNSW parameters depends on your data, embedding function, and requirements for recall, and performance. You may need to experiment with different construction and search values to find the values that meet your requirements.\n\nFor example, for a dataset with 50,000 embeddings of 2048 dimensions, generated by\n\n```python\nembeddings = np.random.randn(50000, 2048).astype(np.float32).tolist()\n```\n\nwe set up two Chroma collections:\n* The first is configured with `hnsw:ef_search: 10`. When querying using a specific embedding from the set (with `id = 1`), the query takes `0.00529` seconds, and we get back embeddings with distances:\n\n```\n[3629.019775390625, 3666.576",
    "1cf76854-f1ba-4010-a1e4-2df18eebf33c": "904296875, 3684.57080078125]\n``` \n\n* The second collection is configured with `hnsw:ef_search: 100` and `hnsw:ef_construction:1000`. When issuing the same query, this time it takes `0.00753` seconds (about 42% slower), but with better results as measured by their distance:\n\n```\n[0.0, 3620.593994140625, 3623.275390625]\n```\n\nIn this example, when querying with the test embedding (`id=1`), the first collection failed to find the embedding itself, despite it being in the collection (where it should have appeared as a result with a distance of `0.0`). The second collection, while slightly slower, successfully found the query embedding itself (shown by the `0.0` distance) and returned closer neighbors overall, demonstrating better accuracy at the cost of performance.\n\n# Create, Get, and Delete Chroma Collections\n\nChroma lets you manage collections of embeddings, using the `collection` primitive.\n\nChroma uses collection names in the url, so there are a few restrictions on naming them:\n\n- The length of the name must be between ",

Latency increases as collections grow: see [Latency and collection size](./performance#latency-and-collection-size) below for a full analysis.\n\n## Memory and collection size\n\nChroma uses a fork of [`hnswlib`](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib) to efficiently index and search over embedding vectors. The HNSW algorithm requires that the embedding index reside in system RAM to query or update.\n\nAs such, the amount of available system memory defines an upper bound on the size of a Chroma collection (or multiple collections, if they are being used concurrently",
    "e69e12c2-a605-456f-b2f7-bdf6ace96e96": ".) If a collection grows larger than available memory, insert and query latency spike rapidly as the operating system begins swapping memory to disk. The memory layout of the index is not amenable to swapping, and the system quickly becomes unusable.\n\nTherefore, users should always plan on having enough RAM provisioned to accommodate the anticipated total number of embeddings.\n\nTo analyze how much RAM is required, we launched an an instance of Chroma on variously sized EC2 instances, then inserted embeddings until each system became non-responsive. As expected, this failure point corresponded linearly to RAM and embedding count.\n\nFor 1024 dimensional embeddings, with three metadata records and a small document per embedding, this works out to `N = R * 0.245` where `N` is the max collection size in millions, and `R` is the amount of system RAM required in gigabytes. Remember, you wil also need reserve at least a gigabyte for the system\u2019s other needs, in addition to the memory required by Chroma.\n\nThis pattern holds true up through about 7 million embeddings, which is as far as we tested. At this point Chroma is still fast and stable, and we did not find a strict upper bound on the size of",

The amount of space required is a combination of the space required to save the HNSW embedding index, and the space required by the sqlite database used to store documents and embedding metadata.\n\nThe calculations for persisting the HNSW index are similar to that for calculating RAM size. As a rule of thumb, just make sure a system\u2019s storage is at least as big as its RAM, plus several gigabytes to account for the overhead of the operating system and other applications.\n\nThe amount of space required by the sqlite database is highly variable, and depends entirely on whether documents and metadata are being saved in Chroma, and if so, how large they are. Fully exploring all permutations of this are beyond the scope of the experiments we were able to run.\n\nHowever, as a single data point, the sqlite database for a collection with ~40k documents of 1000 words each, and ~600k metadata entries was about 1.7gb.\n\nThere is no strict upper bound on the size of the metadata database: sqlite itself supports databases into the terabyte range, and can page to disk effectively.\n\nIn most realistic use cases,",

Performance is mostly linear with respect to batch size, with a constant overhead to process the HTTP request itself.\n\nExperimentation confirms this: overall throughput (total number of embeddings inserted, across batch size and request count) remains fairly flat between batch sizes of 100-500:\n\n![concurrent-inserts](/concurrent-inserts.png)\n\nGiven that smaller batches have lower, more consistent latency and are less likely to lead to timeout errors, we recommend batches on the smaller side of this curve: anything between 50 and 250 is a reasonable choice.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUsers should feel comfortable relying on Chroma for use cases approaching tens of millions of embeddings, when deployed on the right hardware. It\u2019s average and upper-bound latency for both reads and writes make it a good platform for all but the largest AI-based applications, supporting potentially thousands of simultaneous human users (depending on your application\u2019s backend access patterns.)\n\nAs a single-node solution, though, it won\u2019t scale forever.

In this mode, the Chroma client connects to a Chroma server running in a separate process.\n\nThis means that you can deploy single-node Chroma to a [Docker container](../containers/docker), or a machine hosted by a cloud provider like [AWS](../cloud-providers/aws), [GCP](../cloud-providers/gcp), [Azure](../cloud-providers/azure), and others. Then, you can access your Chroma server from your application using our `HttpClient` (or `ChromaClient` for JS/TS users).\n\nYou can quickly experiment locally with Chroma in client/server mode by using our CLI:\n\n```terminal\nchroma run --path /db_path\n```\n\n{% Tabs %}\n\n{% Tab",

The behaviors and method signatures are identical to the synchronous client, but all methods that would block are now async:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport chromadb\n\nasync def main():\n    client = await chromadb.AsyncHttpClient()\n    collection = await client.create_collection(name=\"my_collection\")\n    await collection.add(\n        documents=[\"hello world\"],\n        ids=[\"id1\"]\n    )\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nIf you intend to deploy your Chroma server, you may want to consider our [thin-client package](./thin-client) for client-side interactions.\n\n{% /Tab %}\n\n{% Tab label=\"typescript\" %}\n\nThen instantiate a new `ChromaClient`.

OpenTelemetry traces allow you to understand how requests flow through the system and quickly identify bottlenecks. Check out the [observability docs](../administration/observability) for a full explanation of the available parameters.\n\nHere's an example of how to create an observability stack with Docker Compose. The stack is composed of\n\n- a Chroma server\n- [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector)\n- [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/)\n\nFirst, paste the following into a new file called `otel-collector-config.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nreceivers:\n  otlp:\n    protocols:\n      grpc:\n        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317\n      http:\n        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318\n\nexporters:\n  debug:\n",

You can call the heartbeat endpoint to quickly create a sample trace:\n\n```terminal\ncurl http",
    "2edf5a7b-ad76-4eed-8918-79bf5df13676": "://localhost:8000/api/v2/heartbeat\n```\n\nThen, click \"Run Query\" in Zipkin to see the trace.",
